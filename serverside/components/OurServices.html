      <h1>this is Our-Services page</h1> 
      <p>When describing the services you offer, its very easy to get caught up in the we. But why wouldnt you? The services page is about what we (your company) can do, and how great you are at it.

         take the approach that Medallia did with there services page. Although they make sure to mention how their services will turn into the solutions for their audience, they make sure to include the reader (or the potential customer) is involved within each of the services.

         Their content is written to make it apparent that the services are not one sided. Medallia intends to work with its customer as if the two are on a team (as all client-customer relationships should be).
